    <p>It&rsquo;s always fun to rethink the world by redefining our terminology. But the brain can only stand so much of this. The cerebrum boils, releasing green gas. The cortex starts to blacken and fray. A shocking, foreign pain arises between the ears. It will not go away.</p>

    <p>So it&rsquo;s a relief when there&rsquo;s a backup word, which already has exactly the right meaning, but is disused and carries no (or at least few) political and emotional associations. This word is &ldquo;caste.&rdquo; The word it replaces is so encrusted in historical nonsense that I won&rsquo;t even say it.</p>

    <p>Of course the word &ldquo;caste&rdquo; is generally associated with India. The US is not India. So if we meant &ldquo;caste&rdquo; in the precise Hindu sense of the word (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnas">varna</a>), there are no castes in the US, except perhaps among some Indian immigrants.</p>

    <p>Some redefinition, therefore, is necessary. Let&rsquo;s define a &ldquo;caste&rdquo; as a social group with its own internal status system. All hominids crave status and will exchange almost anything for it, but different castes assign status in very different ways &mdash; as we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s my taxonomy of American castes. I&rsquo;ve picked names from various historical cultures, hopefully without strong emotional associations for modern readers, for these castes. The implicit analogies these names create should be roughly accurate, but certainly not precise. I have ordered them alphabetically to avoid any implicit ranking.</p>

    <p>In the <em>Brahmin</em> caste, status among both men and women is defined by scholarly achievement, success in an intellectual profession, or position of civic responsibility. The highest-status <em>Brahmins</em> are artists and scientists, but <em>Brahmins</em> can also be doctors or lawyers, although it is much better to be a doctor than a lawyer, and much better to be a lawyer than a dentist (a trade which was perhaps once <em>Brahmin</em>, but is now definitely <em>Vaisya</em>). Ideally, as a <em>Brahmin</em>, if you are a doctor you should be primarily concerned with caring for the poor; if you are a lawyer, your practice should focus on civil liberties and social justice &mdash; cardiology and corporate law are slightly <em>de trop</em>. An increasing number of young <em>Brahmins</em> consider themselves &ldquo;activists&rdquo; and work for &ldquo;nonprofits&rdquo; or &ldquo;NGOs,&rdquo; lending some credence to the theory that the <em>Brahmins</em> are our ruling or governing caste. Entry into the <em>Brahmin</em> caste is conferred almost entirely by first-tier university admissions, although getting into Harvard doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t still need to make something of yourself.</p>

    <p>In the <em>Dalit</em> caste, status among men is defined by power, wealth and sexual success, among women by attractiveness and popularity. The favored occupation of <em>Dalit</em> men is crime, preferably of the organized variety. However, <em>Dalit</em> criminals are not generally psychopathic; they perceive crime as guerrilla warfare against an unjust society. <em>Dalit</em> women may support themselves by crime, welfare (which they consider a right), or payments from men. Both male and female <em>Dalits</em> may occasionally support themselves by conventional employment, but this is usually in jobs that other castes (except <em>Helots</em>) would consider demeaning, and <em>Dalits</em> share this association. The <em>Dalit</em> caste is not monolithic; it is divided into a number of ethnic subcastes, such as African-American, Mexican, etc. A few white <em>Dalits</em> exist, notably in the Appalachians. There is little or no solidarity between the various <em>Dalit</em> ethnicities.</p>

    <p>The <em>Helot</em> caste is an imported peasant caste, originating primarily in rural Central America. Status among <em>Helot</em> men is conferred primarily by hard work, money and power. Status among <em>Helot</em> women is conferred by attractiveness, motherhood, and association with successful men. The <em>Helot</em> value system does not seem to be sustainable in the US, and the children of <em>Helots</em> tend to grow up as <em>Dalits</em>. New <em>Helots</em>, however, can always be imported to replace them.</p>

    <p>The <em>Optimate</em> caste has to be mentioned, because it was until quite recently the US&rsquo;s ruling caste. It is not clear, however, that the <em>Optimate</em> value system still exists in any meaningful sense, and if it does it is decaying rapidly, with most young <em>Optimates</em> becoming <em>Brahmins</em>. However, status among any men and women who do still follow the <em>Optimate</em> way is conferred by birth, breeding and personal character, with wealth serving as a prerequisite but not a mark of actual distinction. The Bible of the <em>Optimate</em> caste is, of course, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_register">Social Register</a>.</p>

    <p>The <em>Vaisya</em> caste is the most difficult to define. It&rsquo;s tempting to say that a <em>Vaisya</em> is anyone who is not a <em>Brahmin</em>, <em>Dalit</em>, <em>Helot</em> or <em>Optimate</em>. Status among <em>Vaisya</em> men is conferred by productive employment, generally defined in monetary terms; by a successful family life; and by participation in church or other formal social groups. Status among <em>Vaisya</em> women is conferred by attractiveness, motherhood, and social participation, with an increasing number of <em>Vaisya</em> women entering the labor force, typically in unintellectual white-collar jobs.</p>

    <p>(<strong>Update</strong>: please see the comment by &ldquo;smb,&rdquo; whose perspective of the present-day <em>Optimate</em> caste is much sharper and clearer than my definition &mdash; which on reflection is too antiquated.):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I am, admittedly, a bit wet behind the ears—as I'm still a senior in college—but what I've seen amongst my social set doesn't align very well with your castes. To give some context, I'm at an Ivy; about a third of my friends went to boarding school, a third private/parochial, and a third went public, as did I; about a third was born 'upper class’. two-thirds were born 'middle class' (widely defined), as was I. Altogether we could be defined as a mix of your Brahmin and Optimate classes.</p>

      <p>I agree with SFG regarding doctors: cardiology and neurology definitely rank above family practice. Re working with the poor: most doctors I know do pro bono work anyway, rather than dedicating their careers to the 'poor.' However, this profession is overall considerably less prestigious than I imagine it once was. Literally all of my friends who have a parent who is a physician were told, in no uncertain terms, that they should avoid the profession completely. Half of the students I know who began as pre-meds have decided against pursuing a medical career, many opting for consulting or investment-banking.</p>

      <p>As far as those who work at various NGOs and nonprofits: they're mostly considered ne'er-do-wells. They largely belong to the 'trustifarian' set—pseudo-bohemians who will never have to work, never appreciate not having to work, and certainly never suffer the consequences of not working. Granted, there are a good number of folks who work at non-profits and think tanks, who are seen as important parts of some political movement or another (but they will probably end up in politics, or going to business or law school).</p>

      <p>For men, banking and consulting are generally considered the jobs to aim for, if one is able to get them. Ambitious women have slightly expanded options: advertising/marketing, PR, auction houses, even teaching (though most of these jobs are considered a spot for women to cool their heels whilst waiting to find a husband; not that anyone dare come out and say so).</p>

      <p>If a fellow is ambitious, but unable to get into either finance or consulting or somesuch field, he will often go the NGO/non-profit route at first. (Another option is government service: CIA, State Dept., military, White House intern.) Down the road he'll apply to business school or law school and begin his career in earnest.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that the quality-of-life for corporate lawyers is considered so dismal that most of those who earn law degrees don't actually ever want to practice law. Those too greedy/ambitious for government service will become paralegals, go to top-notch law schools, and slave away as corporate lawyers for most of their salad days. The 'better' set of lawyers takes the degree and heads to Washington, often bouncing between lobbying, staffing, non-profit, bureaucratic sectors etc. These are the ones who will serve as all points in the iron triangle at some time during their lives.</p>

      <p>Re Steve: Professional athletes (and Hollywood types) are considered hopelessly vulgar.</p>

      <p>Now, regarding entrance into this hybrid Brahmin/Optimate class I've been speaking of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Top-tier universities help, but aren't required. Haverford, Trinity, Bucknell will do.</li>

        <li>Personal character is important. Breeding is not.</li>

        <li>Wealth is not a prerequisite to this broader class.</li>

        <li>Good manners are a prerequisite.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I see vestiges of the Optimate system you propose. I certainly know guys who went to Buckley, Exeter, and then a top Ivy. But America's relentless push to meritocracy has made any presumption of themselves as a ruling class appear incurably rude—amongst themselves, too, not just to us middle class visigoths. After their hundreds of thousands worth of schooling are complete, they tend to strive on the same playing field as those who came from modest suburbs and went to public school.</p>

      <p>Granted, these viewpoints will not quickly be admitted by most of those my age. Most will pretend to deeply admire their friends who enter the peace corps or work at some anti-land mine NGO. Their actual employment decisions are far more telling: very few pick altruistic jobs or 'public service' as a first choice, but rather as last resorts.</p>

      <p>Also, I would say this view is accepted by roughly 80% of those my age, having studied at similar institutions. Half of those could vaguely be considered 'traditionalists.' They want to find good jobs, earn capital (monetary or political), and start families. The other half could be called 'neoliberals.' These are the ones who are simply ambitious and mostly want material success; they feel fewer personal obligations towards family and community; they love both consumerist capitalism and the welfare state.</p>

      <p>The remaining 20% could be called the hangover from the counter-culture. They sneer at most economically productive jobs, and invariably go for the NGO/Peace Corps jobs, or perhaps academe. They would disagree with everything I've written above, but probably admit that most of their fellow students see things more or less as I do.</p>
